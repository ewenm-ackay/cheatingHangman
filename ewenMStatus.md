Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

- Defined a function to display the rules for users who do not know how to play.
- Defined a slowPrint function to help with the looks
- Defined a function to get the difficulty declared by a user. The default cheatword is set to "A+", but can be changed when calling the function as it takes
    the cheatword as a parameter.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We need a wordbank and a test wordbank. We also have yet to develop our algorithm for the cheating hangman version, or the easy and hard difficulties. The hardest will be the impossible difficulty,

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We need to make sure our wordbank is large enough and does not repeat.
