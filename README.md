# README file for final project


#### Just the Basics

We want our program to run a complete graphical rendition of a cheating hangman. While we work on the fundamentals of the 
cheats, we will think of any and all ways we can change this common idea into something unique to us.

We will be writing this in python. Originally, we thought about using turtles to draw the hangman, but there are most likely other, more customizable and simpler ways to do this, such as pygames.
