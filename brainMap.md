1. Make a hangman game

"Welcome blah blha yhis is how to play"

2. Draw Hangman
                drawHangman(listOfParts)
                for part in listOfParts:
                    if part == 'body':
                        drawBody()
                    if part == "head':
                        drawHead()
3. Make it really hard
